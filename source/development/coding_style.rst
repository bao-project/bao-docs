Coding Guidelines
=================

This document specifies a set of coding guidelines including code style,
formatting and file structuring and organization that shall be applied when
contributing code to the Bao project. We strive so that most of the guidelines
can be automatically checked or even enforced by the CI pipeline and try to
minimize guidelines which can not be automatically addressed. However, in the
few instances this is not possible, responsibility falls upon code reviewers
and maintainers to uphold these guidelines are applied as much as possible.
