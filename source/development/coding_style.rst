Coding Guidelines
=================

This document specifies a set of coding guidelines, including code style,
formatting, file structuring and organization that shall be applied when
contributing code to the Bao project. We strive to ensure that most of the
guidelines can be automatically checked or even enforced by the CI pipeline and
minimize guidelines that can not be automatically addressed. In cases where it
is not feasible to automatically enforce certain guidelines, the responsibility
lies with the code reviewers and maintainers to ensure that these guidelines
are adhered to as closely as possible.

C Language
----------

The coding style and guidelines for C development are heavily influenced and
constrained by the MISRA C:2012 guidelines, which should take precedence above
all others in this document or elsewhere.
