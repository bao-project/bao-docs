    PIV
        The Platform Initialization Vector (PIV) is a data structure that
        stores information regarding the initialization state of different
        system components at both the CPU and platform level.

    PACV
        The Partition Access Control Vector (PACV) is a data structure that
        contains the access control policy for a system's partitions. This
        policy establishes the permissions for each partition to access the
        platform's resources.

    Asset
        An asset is a valuable resource that must be properly maintained and
        managed. The state of an asset must be carefully monitored and
        controlled to prevent vulnerabilities or errors from causing harm or
        decreasing an assets value.

    Subject
        A subject is an entity that can access or interact with a system, its
        resources and its assets. This can include individuals, other systems
        (e.g., through a remote connection), and specific system components
        such as VMs and VMMs.
